# Multithreaded-Chat
This project was extremely time consuming yet I had a fantastic time implementing it. 
I gave it the codename Christopher (a reference to the amazing movie the imitation game
when). Its a UDP communications protocol that uses 4 threads (essentially executing 4 processes in parallel). Built to
work in SFUs LAN in the CSIL labs.
